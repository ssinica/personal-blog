<p>In December 2015 I wrote a <a href="inline-skating-2015.html">blog post</a> dedicated to my new hobbie - inline skating. Now, a year after that, I think, it is a time to document my progress.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to <a href="https://www.endomondo.com">Endomondo</a> I rolled 830 km in 2016 (actually, I believe this number is bigger in reality, because sometimes I forgot to start the app).</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/skating2016/stats_2016.png" alt="Skating statistics in 2016">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Occasionally I post some images to <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=skating%20%40ssinica&amp;src=typd">twitter</a> during skating - so, make sure you follow me there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My resolutions for 2016 were:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Confident on streets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confident one leg balancing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&gt; 20 km/h average speed on trace</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jumps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Power-slide</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic back forward</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic low speed tricks (spinning, turning, changing direction, etc&#8230;)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And I am happy to say, that almost everything from this list is completed (and even more!).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My power-slide still is far from perfect, but I am working on it. I am very confident on streets. Actually, during last year I skated thru my town in all directions. And it was so much fun, that I almost totally abandoned skating on the trail. With this, my average speed dropped, of course, but who cares?! I understand now, that speed is not the most exciting part.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also I learned how to jump - this really openned streets for me. One leg balancing also became much better - I can skate on one leg for at least 20 meters (maybe more).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I learned and mastered spinning around - now I use this technique all the time when I need to stop at low speeds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My back forwards are not that good, but I learned the basics. Will continue to work on that this year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, I am very satisfied with the results. Probably, I could learn new stuff faster - but  I take it slow to limit injuries possibilities. I even think to start wearing a helmet next season. Because, you know, I fall very rarely now, but more painfully - the speed is bigger now and I skate in places not really meant for that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Few months ago I started to skate in local skate park - a lot of lessons learned there.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my previous post I mentioned, that maybe I will try to film some skating videos. And I did - welcome youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYgcz1wl5ohjxO_3S33EZzg">"Life on 8 wheels"</a></p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/skating2016/youtube.png" alt="Life on 8 wheels youtube channel">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Right now I have 13 videos. A little bit more than 10 subscribers and almost 500 views in total. I experimented a lot with format, content, length, etc&#8230; So this is still work in progress and channel may change. Anyway, I think, I will continue to do small (5-10 min) videos from my skating sessions in 2017. So, please, subscribe!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The weather in December was awful for inline skating and I decided to try ice skating. After few trips to local Ice Stadium and skating in rental skates, I decided that I should proceed and get my own skates. But instead of ice skates I bought ice blades for my inline skates at <a href="https://www.proskatersplace.com">https://www.proskatersplace.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And I must say that the result is very good - I do not feel the difference comparing with ordinal ice skates. But I feel much more comfortable in my inline skates and also it is easier to put them on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am very happy with ice skating as temporal replacement for inline during the winter. Now almost daily I go to local open ice rink.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to 2017.  Probably I will upgrade my current skates to better ones. Will skate and create videos more. So see ya in the next skating season!</p>

<p>In 2015 I got a new hobby - inline skating.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The decision to try inline skating was fairly spontaneous and mainly driven by my wife. The beautiful idea was - we will skate together in sunset holding hands.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/skating/first.png" alt="First time skating">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well, month or two later my wife gave up and decided what it is too dangerous and tricky. Yes, we tried to skate together and even hold hands few times, but very soon our expectations and goals became too different. My wife was OK to skate really slowly and only on ideal surface and in ideal environment. On the other hand, I wanted to go faster, try new things and study some tricks. So I started to skate alone and my wife joined me very rarely.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/skating/route.png" alt="Usual route">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was hard from beginning. For a month we practiced in a big and free from cars parking area. After we learned some basics we moved to special trail outside the town. Most of the summer I spent on this 3 km long path with ideal asphalt.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/skating/path.png" alt="3 km of ideal asphalt">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is some statistics:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/skating/stats.png" alt="Skating statistics for 2005">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In May I started to skate on trail. 4 months I trained for speed. From 9 km/h to 17 km/h. In the middle of that period I replaced my very basic wheels and bearings to more advanced. This gave me faster speed.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/skating/wheels.png" alt="Wheels">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, my technique also progressed. I felt pretty confident and because inline skating is not very popular in my town I was the fastest guy on the trace. Well, not always. Sometimes I was smashed by guys who clearly had more experience in inline skating and better equipment. But I was close.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In November and December there is a noticeable speed drop. This is because I started to skate on the streets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was scary and very challenging. All these obstacles, rough surfaces, pedestrians, cars&#8230;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will be laughing, but during all the summer I was skating without any real stopping technique. I kinda was able to stop very slowly, but this was not enough for streets. So before going to city I studied T-stop.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/skating/t-stop.png" alt="T-Stop">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is very basic and most used stopping technique. It is basic, but not simple. Before you will be able to do T-stop you should master to balance on one leg. Basically you should be able to roll on one leg for few seconds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In October, finally, I learned how to do T-stop and in November I started to skate near my house. My current usual route consist of bicycle roads and sidewalks. There are pedestrians, road crossings, different surfaces - asphalt, very bad asphalt and different kinds of tiles.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, that I accomplished in 2015:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Confident forward skating</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>T-stop</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Basic turns</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The plan for 2016 is:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Confident on streets</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Basic back forward</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic low speed tricks (spinning, turning, changing direction, etc&#8230;)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All this year I was watching few youtube channels about inline skating and skating in streets. Most inspiring and interesting channels are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PintoPonyProductions">PintoPonyProductions</a></p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think I will try to film something similar next year. It should be fun. So, stay tuned!</p>
